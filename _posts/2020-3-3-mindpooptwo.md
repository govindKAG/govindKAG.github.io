# And so it begins...again

It's been ages since I've put any of my writing online. I did't stop because I hit a cosmic wall of apathy nor because feedback scared me. I didn't start doing it for any profound reason either. It started because I needed it to. It stopped because I didn't need it anymore. Until now. I need it again. So here it begins. yet again.
